## Project Description 📖

In emergency situations, every second counts. Blaghk (بلاغك) is an AI tool that classifies audio inputs to identify the nature of the emergency. It then directs the report to the corresponding emergency service, such as medical aid, fire department, or police assistance. This intelligent system minimizes the time taken to relay critical information, thereby expediting the response time of emergency services.

The dataset used for training our AI model has been meticulously recorded and transcribed by our dedicated team members, ensuring a robust and diverse collection of audio samples for accurate classification.

## Technology Stack 💻

We have utilized a combination of technologies to bring Blaghk (بلاغك) to life:

- **Streamlit**: An open-source app framework that is the cornerstone of our user interface, providing a seamless and interactive front-end experience. 🖥️
- **Jupyter Notebook**: A web-based interactive computing platform used for the development of our Python-based backend. It has been instrumental in prototyping and testing our AI models. 📓
